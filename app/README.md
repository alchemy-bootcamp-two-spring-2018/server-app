# My First Server Project

##  Video Game Database

In this Project I am creating a database of my favorite games or games that I wish to complete.
There are fields to enter the Name of the Game, The Console it was Released on, The release Year and a checkbox for it has been completed or not.

This Vue app will pass on its information to the api.js service file, which will in turn talk to my node server which in turn talks to a postgress database.
