# My First Server App

## About

This server includes a JSON file containing a list of sample daily blood glucose readings. Sample data can be removed manually so that list that renders to page is only the user's data. 

## To Run

* Fork repository, clone locally, navigate to repository directory,
* Download all the files,
* Launch app in Vue,
* Start server with npm on local host.
