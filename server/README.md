# My First Server Project
@RyLuras    -     Ryan Luras

##  Video Game Database

In this Project I am creating a database of my favorite games or games that I wish to complete.
There are fields to enter the Name of the Game, The Console it was Released on, The release Year and a checkbox for it has been completed or not.

This server talks back and forth from the Vue app and the postgress database. We are continually updating the capabilities of the Vue and Server parts.

NEEDED PACKAGES:

-postgress
-express
-cors
